      American-style amber lagers are light amber to amber or copper colored.
      They are medium bodied. There is a noticeable degree of caramel-type malt
      character in flavor and often in aroma. This is a broad category in which
      the hop bitterness, flavor, and aroma may be accentuated or may only be
      present at relatively low levels, yet noticeable. Fruity esters, diacetyl,
      and chill haze should be absent.
